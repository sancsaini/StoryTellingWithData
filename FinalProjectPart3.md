## Part 3
### Intended audience for the story
College students availing US healthcare. The assumption here is that this audience has basic knowledge of navigating websites. 
Some of the things done specifically for this audience include giving a natural drill down structure to the story:
* Begins by capturing the national level picture
* Proceeds to a state level picture
* Then contrasts the mean state level values to the payments that individual physicians received
* Finally it showcases how payments vary from one physician to another
The story includes a link to a portal which the users can use to search for payments on their physicians, and has interactive visualizations to enable user engagement. 

#### Work done so far
The project began with an idea of informing students about the payments their physicians receive from pharmaceutical companies. 
* Initially, I created a rough story behind what I wanted to communicate: the Sunshine Act which allows for this information to be collected followed by information at national, state-wide and Pennsylvania focussed data visualizations. This was accompanied by the identification of a method and medium for communicating this story.
* Next, I decided to draft a wireframe for my story. I decided to display individual physician level information instead of Pennsylvania wide picture because that would've involved the users more in my opinion (given the varied demographics of Heinz College students). I obtained user feedback via a research plan linked in Part 2 of this project, and came up with the final wireframe for my story. 
* Finally, when it came to create the story, I realized faced issues while responsively embedding Infogram and DataWrapper objects into my ShortHand story. This is when I decided to swap out some of my visualizations with Tableau versions. The responsiveness isn't the best even with Tableau objects, but it seems workable.   

### Access my final shorthand story

The resources used are referenced in the story itself.

### Planned improvements
* Enable a search functionality that enables the user to search for payments on their physician on the same page.
* Improve page's look and feel through HTML control.

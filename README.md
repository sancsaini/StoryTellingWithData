# StoryTellingWithData
Visualizations made for Telling Stories With Data coursework

# About me
I am an Information Systems Management student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College. Prior to coming to Heinz, I was working with ZS Associates as a Technology Analyst for ~3 years where I was helping Fortune 500 clients manage their data and derive actionable insights from them. My work exposed me to the domain of report design (which is when I bought 'Good Charts' and 'Storytelling With Data', but never read them). I also realized that different clients had different levels of analytical comprehension, and that we couldn't communicate with them in the same way. I'm really passionate about music and data analysis (woah! That escalated quickly.), and can't help myself from diving into music albums as well as datasets with the same rigor. 

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn the following from the course:
1. Understand terminologies used to refer to visualizations so that I speak the same language as everyone else
2. Learn how to design for audiences and how to understand their comprehension level
3. Learn best practices, but also apply them in a hands-on manner to commit them to my memory

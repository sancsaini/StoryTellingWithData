## Project Name: How much do pharma cos spend on your doctors?

### Project Summary
Pharmaceutical companies engage in transfers of value with physicians. While anti-kickback laws exist to prevent monetarily-incentivised kickbacks for physicians, it is important for patients to be aware of the linkages between pharmaceutical companies and their physicians. 

### Project Structure
The project will begin with an introduction to Sunshine Act, which mandates drug manufacturers to report certain transfers of value made to physicians and hospitals. This will be followed by a national picture of such exchanges (based on monetary value), followed by a cross-state analysis of trends and finally diving into trends in Pennsylvania.

The objective of the project is to inform readers about the linkages b/w pharma cos and their doctors. This will be followed by links to URLs where people leveraging the US medical system can see how much drug manufacturers spend on their doctors. This should help them see if their doctor might be prescribing them certain drugs under the influence of specific pharmaceutical players.

### The data
The Sunshine Act mandates drug manufacturers to report their data to CMS, which publishes the dataset annually at [this link](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/browse). I'll be referencing the 2017 mostly for this project which is available at the following two links:
* [General Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/dataset/General-Payment-Data-Detailed-Dataset-2017-Reporti/a3u6-h38p) 
* [Research Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/dataset/Research-Payment-Data-Detailed-Dataset-2017-Report/pg9r-tqp5)

### Method and Medium
The project will be Shorthand-based.
I'm only planning support for Desktop screens. The project will include some interactive maps along with visualizations mainly created using Tableau. I'll check with my test users if I should implement the functionality to search for payments made on a particular doctor on my own, or simply provide a link to CMS' search functionality. The former will be better since that will enable me to create custom visualizations to plot the expenses made on searched doctors. 
Since Shorthand uses images, I'll search for relevant images through Getty Images. I'll try to avoid photos of the Obama administration (which passed the Affordable Care Act which the Sunshine Act was a part of) inorder to avoid inducing party-based opinions on my story.

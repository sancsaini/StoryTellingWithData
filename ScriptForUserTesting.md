## Testing Script

### Introductory comments
* Brief introduction: Share name and program at Heinz
* Very brief discussion of the purpose of today’s test: “My goal today is to get feedback on a webpage that a classmate of mine is designing. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 minutes of your time. Please remember when I say ‘test’ I mean I’m testing our website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”

### Main section
Ask: What's your program at Heinz and what is your background?
"I’ve got a printed version of the front page here. Imagine somebody sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. If you could, please put a question mark next to anything (word, phrase, section, prompt) that you find confusing. Put a plus sign next to anything that makes sense to you and that you'd like more information about. Feel free to suggest any changes: additions/ modifications/ deletions/ reordering as you go through it."

Prompts for questions to underrespond to any questions with further discussion.
* "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this site is for?"
* "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?" or "Who do you think this site is for?"
* "Would you use this site?" or "Would you click on XYZ buttons?"
* "What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"

### Wrap-up
“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”
